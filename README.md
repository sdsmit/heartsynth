# Max Patches

The audio processing for this patch was broken into 3 seperate patches, synth1.maxpat controlled the additive synth engine, drumSubPatch.maxpat generated and sequenced percussive noises, and mainPatch handled the input from arduino and did all the visual processing. 

# Hardware

Included is a diagram of how the hardware works (hardwareDiagram). This system used an arduino, switches, potentiometers, and a heartrate monitor.
